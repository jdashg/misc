# Temporary Browser Extensions via Content Scripts

## Loading in Firefox

1. Go to about:debugging
2. Select your running instance of the browser by clicking "This Nightly"
  * Or if you have and want to use another instance (e.g. on your phone) you can select that instead
3. Under "Temporary Extensions", click "Load Temporary Add-on..."
4. Select `path/to/manifest.json`

There's a "Reload" button for when you changed anything (including included files) in the extension.
